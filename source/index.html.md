# Introduction

Welcome to the go~mus API documentation! You can use our API to access go~mus API endpoints, which can get information on various entities in our database.

We have examples using curl! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.

# Public API

The Public API provides public accessible information about museums, exhibitions, tours, events and tickets.

See [detailed documentation on Public API](/public_api.html).

# Reseller API

The Reseller API allows you to directly sell products (events, tours and tickets) to customers using the go~mus API.

See [detailed documentation on Reseller API](/reseller_api.html).
